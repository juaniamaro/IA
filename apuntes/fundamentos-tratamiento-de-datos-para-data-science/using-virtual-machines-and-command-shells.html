<h1>COMMAND SHELL</h1>

<p>
   A shell is, by definition, an application that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system. Its main function is to interpret commands written in text, execute them, and return the results also in text format.
   In addition to processing simple commands, the shell allows you to automate tasks using scripts, manage processes, redirect input and output, chain commands, and control the working environment (variables, permissions, paths, etc.). Thanks to this, it becomes a very powerful tool for both daily use and system administration and development.
   In short, the shell not only allows you to communicate with the operating system, but also offers a complete control language that facilitates advanced interaction, automation, and efficient management of system resources.
